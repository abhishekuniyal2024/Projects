    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps Followed**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Image Preprocessing**\n",
    "- Load the image using OpenCV.\n",
    "- Convert the image to grayscale.\n",
    "- Apply a Bilateral Filter to remove noise while preserving edges.\n",
    "- Perform Otsu’s Thresholding to enhance text visibility.\n",
    "- Resize the image to improve text clarity and increase DPI.\n",
    "- Save the preprocessed image for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Text Extraction using Tesseract OCR**\n",
    "- Define the Tesseract-OCR path.\n",
    "- Use the `pytesseract.image_to_string()` function to extract text from the processed image.\n",
    "- Optimize OCR performance using `--oem 3 --psm 4` configuration.\n",
    "- Save the extracted text to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Accuracy Evaluation**\n",
    "- Load both the extracted text and ground truth text from files.\n",
    "- Perform text preprocessing (lowercasing, space normalization, punctuation removal).\n",
    "- Calculate different accuracy metrics:\n",
    "  - **Character-Level Accuracy** using Levenshtein Distance.\n",
    "  - **Word-Level Accuracy** using word matching and similarity.\n",
    "  - **Sequence Matching Score** using `SequenceMatcher`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Results**\n",
    "| Metric | Accuracy |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| Character-Level Accuracy | **93.54%** |\n",
    "| Word-Level Accuracy | **90.55%** |\n",
    "| Sequence Matching Score | **96.63%** |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- The OCR model performs well, achieving a high accuracy across different metrics.\n",
    "- Preprocessing steps such as thresholding and resizing significantly improve text recognition.\n",
    "- The character-level accuracy indicates minor discrepancies, likely due to font variations or noise.\n",
    "- Word-level accuracy suggests that some words might be misrecognized or omitted.\n",
    "- Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning preprocessing techniques or using deep learning-based OCR models.\n",
